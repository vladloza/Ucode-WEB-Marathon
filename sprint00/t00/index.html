    <h2 id="t0">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a
        normal person couldn’t.
        So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional
            than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish
        good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br> For instance, a
        good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest
        story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.<br>
